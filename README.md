🧪 Manual Testing Project — OpenCart E-Commerce Application
End-to-End QA Documentation (Test Plan, Scenarios, Test Cases, RTM, Execution, Bug Reports)

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete Manual Testing Project performed on the OpenCart E-Commerce Application.
It covers all major QA artifacts used in real-time projects, following STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and industry-standard documentation.

This project demonstrates my ability to work as a Manual QA Engineer, covering requirement analysis, test planning, test design, execution, defect reporting, and test closure.

🎯 Project Objectives

Understand AUT (OpenCart – online shopping application)
Analyze Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)
Prepare complete test documentation
Execute test cases in multiple test cycles
Identify, report, and track defects
Perform retesting & regression testing
Provide real-time quality assurance deliverables

🛠️ Application Under Test (AUT)

Cycle-wise results

✔ 7. Bug Report

All defects found during execution with:
Bug ID
Summary
Steps to reproduce
Severity & priority
Expected vs Actual result
Screenshots (if applicable)

Reflects proper defect lifecycle understanding.

🚦 Testing Approach
🔹 1. Smoke Testing
Performed on the initial build to ensure stability.

🔹 2. Sanity Testing
Performed on each new build before deep testing.

🔹 3. Functional Testing
Validating all features end-to-end using approved test cases.

🔹 4. Retesting
Re-executing failed test cases after developer fixes.
🔹 5. Regression Testing

Ensuring new changes or fixes do not break existing features.

🔹 6. Ad-hoc & Exploratory Testing
Unscripted testing to identify hidden/edge defects.
